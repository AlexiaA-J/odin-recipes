        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

            <b>Cook the noodles:</b> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.

        <li>
            <b>Make the cheese layer:</b> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.

        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Assemble the lasagna:</b> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Bake the lasagna:</b> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.
